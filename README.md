# hello-world
First repository - test via GitHub Guides
My name is Sammy Park and I am a 24-year old Swedish Korean working and living in Stockholm, Sweden. I am learning about Github via the coursera course in order to gain knowledge and experience with data science and data processing for my position as a Laboraotry Technician at Karolinska Institute.
